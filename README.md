# SDL Bach Demo

Small SDL2 demo inspired by the famous AmigaBASIC demo (on the Extras disk).

Sometime in the mid '80s, I bought myself an Amiga 500. On the Extras disk,
there was an AmigaBASIC demo that had a profound effect on me. We used to
call it "the Bach demo", because it drew a line effect, which I thought was
really cool, to Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by J.S. Bach.

I could watch the demo for hours on end. It inspired me to learn about the
Blitter's line drawing mode so that I could recreate the demo in assmebly.

Many years later, I still think back to my Amiga days (and my earlier days
with Commodore 8-bit computers: the VIC 20, the Commodore 64 and the
Commodore 128). I had a bad day, with the boss being a total jerk, so I
decided to put this little thing together, as a trip down memory lane.

## Credits

I got the music from here: http://www.orangefreesounds.com/jesu-joy-of-mans-desiring/. It is under CC BY 3.0.

My version may look quite different from the original, but this is 100%
inspired by the AmigaBASIC original. I am sure that if the AmigaBASIC
version had been written on today's hardware, it would have looked far
better than my own.

## Building

Make sure you have SDL2 and SDL2\_Mixer, along with their devel packages.
After that, make should just work.
